1) What are the differences between WGS, WES and RNAseq? Give an example of when you would use each type of sequencing?

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is used in various applications such as examining DNA sequences (whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES)), RNA-Sequencing ect.
Whole-genome sequencing determines the order of all nucleotides in an individualâ€™s DNA and can uncover variation in any part of the human genome, including coding, noncoding, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions. 
In some instances, WGS is the better option because DNA variations outside protein-coding regions can affect gene activity and protein production, potentially leading to genetic disorders.

Whole-exome sequencing focuses on the genomic proteincoding regions (exons). 
Although the human exome represents only 1-5% of the genome, it contains approximately 85% of known disease-related variants.
1 As such, researchers performing WES achieve comprehensive coverage of coding variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). 
Despite lengthier sample preparation due to the additional target enrichment step, scientists benefit from quicker sequencing and data analysis compared to WGS. 
WES provides greater sequencing depth for researchers interested in identifying genetic variants for numerous applications, including population genetics, genetic disease research, and cancer studies.

RNA-sequencing is a sequencing technique which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment, 
analyzing the continuously changing cellular transcriptome. 
Specifically, RNA-Seq facilitates the ability to look at alternative gene spliced transcripts, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusion, mutations/SNPs and changes in gene expression over time, 
or differences in gene expression in different groups or treatments.
